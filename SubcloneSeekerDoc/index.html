<div class="textblock"><h1>SubcloneSeeker </h1>
<p>Computational Framework to reconstructing tumor clone structures</p>
<h1>Introduction </h1>
<p>Clonal heterogeneity is a defining feature of many tumor types, and the elucidation of the subclones that exist within the tumor sample, together with the corresponding cellular fractions, is essential to understand tumorigenesis, relapse, and metastasis. We developed a software framework, SubcloneSeeker, that examines somatic variation events (such as copy number changes, loss of heterozygosity, or point mutations) in order to identify the underlying subclone structure, i.e. the subclones including the normal (non-cancerous) cells and their cellular frequencies within the tumor tissue.</p>
<h2>Directory Structure </h2>
<p>'src' directory contains all the classes that consists of the SubcloneSeeker core library, in which the basic data types and logics for representing somatic mutations, mutation clusters and subclones are defined.</p>
<p>'utils' directory contains the source code for many command-line utilities that utilizing the SubcloneSeeker core library.</p>
<p>'test' directory contains the test cases for the core library.</p>
<p>'doc' directory contains the project's documentation, generated by Doxygen</p>
<p>'contrib' directory contains third part libraries that the project uses.</p>

<p>SubcloneSeeker distributes in the format of source code. You can compile and install it on your platform with relative ease since the project is managed by GNU autotools.</p>
<h2>Requirement </h2>
<p>In order to successfully compile the project, you will need no more than a working c++ compiler on a Unix / Linux system. For generating the documentation, you will, in addition, need Doxygen installed at places where its binary can be found in PATH environment variable.</p>
<h2>Getting the source code </h2>
<p>The latest release of SubcloneSeeker is 1.0, which can be downloaded at <a href="https://github.com/yiq/SubcloneSeeker">https://github.com/yiq/SubcloneSeeker</a></p>
<h2>Compile </h2>
<p>Like any other project that is under the management of GNU autotools, you perform the following from the project's source tree: </p><pre class="fragment">./configure
make
</pre><p>If you like to run the test suite, execute the following </p><pre class="fragment">make check
</pre><p>These are unit tests to ensure the correctness of the source code. They would come in handy if you want to modify the source code</p>
<p>Note: The project does not support VPATH build yet. It needs to be built in the source tree directly</p>
<h2>Installation </h2>
<p>All the command-line utilities will be created in the 'utils' directory. They can be run directly from there, or should you choose to, be installed into your system (usually defaults to /usr/local/bin) with the following command </p><pre class="fragment">make install
</pre><p>This will also install the statically compiled SubcloneSeeker core library libss.a into /usr/local/lib</p>
<h2>Uninstall </h2>
<p>Simply execute </p><pre class="fragment">make uninstall
</pre><p>from the source tree to uninstall the binaries from your system</p>
<h1>Running the examples </h1>
<p>There are four examples prepared for you in a easy-to-run fashion. Each of the example represents a figure in the article. In order reproduce the figures, make sure you have R installed, and the binary can be found through PATH lookup. If you run the following command </p><pre class="fragment">which R
</pre><p>And see an absolute path, such as '/usr/bin/R', then the requirement is satisfied</p>
<h2>Getting the example tarball </h2>
<p>The example tarball consists of four results presented in the paper. The tarball is at the root directory of the source tree.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yiq/SubcloneSeeker/blob/master/examples.tar.gz">https://github.com/yiq/SubcloneSeeker/blob/master/examples.tar.gz</a></p>
<h2>Setup the variables </h2>
<p>Navigate to the example directory on a commandline. Edit the file 'setup.sh' so that it reflects how you organized the project files. Make sure that you have compiled the binaries in the SubcloneSeeker project. If you haven't done so, please refer to the 'INSTALLATION' section in this document.</p>
<h3>Example-1: Simulation</h3>
<p><b>Directory: 01-simulation</b></p>
<p>The first example simulates 1000 tumors, each with 3, 4, ..., 8 subclones. Subclone Deconvolution is then performed on all the samples, and statistics will be collected as in how many possible solutions for each tumor. You can initiate the simulation by running the 'sim.sh' script </p><pre class="fragment">./sim.sh
</pre><p>Note that this will take some time to finish, especially in the case 7 or 8 subclones per tumor. Results will be stored in 'result' directory. To plot the results, launch R in the example directory and run the 'plot.r' scriot </p><pre class="fragment">R
source('plot.r');
</pre><p>A result set from a run executed on my computer is also provided, if you just want to plot the results. In that case, please use the 'plot_prerun.r' script</p>
<h3>Example-2: Purity estimation with the thyroid cancer cell-line dataset</h3>
<p><b>Directory: 02-thyroid</b></p>
<p>In this example, a thyroid cancer cell line (thus very high purity) was sequenced, and its sequencing reads were combined with those reads from sequencing the paired-normal sample at various ratios. Subclone deconvolution is performed on each of the digitally created samples, and purity estimation is reported. In order to run the example, simple type </p><pre class="fragment">make
</pre><p>in the example directory, as it will take care of removing old results (if you run it before), creating required directories, running the deconvolution and plotting the result. After the execution, a file 'SamplePurity.pdf' should be created in the same directory, which contains the plotted result.</p>
<h3>Example-3: Re-analysis of the dataset presented in Ding et, al. 2012</h3>
<p>execute </p><pre class="fragment">make
</pre><p>and marvel at the results ......</p>
<p>(More content to be written......)</p>
<h3>Example-4: Analysis of two OvCa cancer sample Single Nucleotide Polymorphism dataset</h3>
<p>execute </p><pre class="fragment">make
</pre><p>and marvel at the results ......</p>
<p>(More content to be written......) </p>
